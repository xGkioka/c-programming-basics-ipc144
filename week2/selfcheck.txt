1) We can store 256 different values 
2) Float and Dooble are floating-point data types 
    used to store numbers with demical points in programming
    key differences: storage size,precision and range of values
    similarities: floating-Point types,Approximation
3) What is the best data type to store each of the values below?
The number of people living in Canada : double
pi to 2 decimal places :float
The answer to a multiple choice question where the choices are A,B,C or D : char
