## 📂 Project 2: Veterinary Clinic / Inventory System
*Note: Rename this section based on your specific final assignment (e.g., Grocery Store, Veterinary Clinic).*

A comprehensive management system built to handle inventory tracking, appointment scheduling, or patient records. This project extends the concepts of Project 1 by introducing persistent storage and advanced logic.

### Key Features
* **File Persistence**: Reads from and writes to external `.txt` or `.csv` files to ensure data is saved between sessions.
* **Dynamic Reporting**: Generates formatted reports of current inventory or patient lists.
* **Advanced Logic**: Implements sorting and filtering algorithms to organize large datasets.

### Technical Implementation
* **File I/O**: Usage of `fopen`, `fprintf`, and `fscanf` for data serialization.
* **Pointer Arithmetic**: Efficient data manipulation and passing by reference.
* **Macros & Constants**: rigorous use of `#define` for maintainable code configuration.
