## 📂 Project 1: Contact Management System
A modular application designed to manage personal and business contact information. The system focuses on data validation and structural organization of related data types.

### Key Features
* **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and display contact details (Name, Address, Numbers).
* **Input Validation**: Robust helper functions to ensure data integrity (e.g., checking for valid phone numbers, enforcing mandatory fields).
* **Search Functionality**: Algorithms to traverse arrays and retrieve specific records.

### Technical Implementation
* **Structs**: Utilized nested C structures to model complex entities.
* **Modularization**: Code split across multiple source files (`contacts.c`, `core.c`) with header guards to manage dependencies.
